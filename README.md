# Webscraping Alternatives for RAG LLM

## Current Implementation
- Takes screenshots of webpage
- Uses OCR (Optical character recognition) on PDFs,
however, for dropdown elements and others, this method can yield inconsistent results.

## New Implementation  
- Leverages Firefox browser's accessibility mode through a js library called "readibility"
- Extracts text from the accessibility mode in a cleaner and summarized format 
- Overall simpler and less computationally expensive

Currently, the selenium-readibility.py script outputs 2 .txt files in an "output" directory, one of the old implementation and one of the new, for the same specified url.

### Analysis
Between the two, the first contains much more extraneous and unhelpful content, which could muddle the vectorizing process for the LLM. Comparatively, the second one, which may contain some unnecessary phrases like "loading...", still is a cleaner and more precise interpretation of the webpage. The script used is quite elementary and could be improved upon to improve the sophistication of formatting and output format.
